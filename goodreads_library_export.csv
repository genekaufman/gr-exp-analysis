In Replay, a middle-aged man has a heart attack and instead of dying, wakes up earlier in his life, as a college student, complete with all the memories of the next 20+ years. He dies and re-awakens many times, and I don't want to spoil that book here, so I'll stop. But Toward Yesterday is exactly the premise of Replay, but extended to the entire population of the earth. Ok, so Toward Yesterday isn't exactly a truly original book, but there were many thought-provoking issues that came up, only some of which were brought up by the book, but quite a few that have me thinking (one, right off the top of my head: if a person was born only a short time (let's say ""weeks"") after the time reset, would they still be born the same person as before?)<br/>2) Kurt Vonnegut wrote a book called [b:Timequake|9594|Timequake|Kurt Vonnegut|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1405784951s/9594.jpg|6835609], in which the entirety of the population jumps back 10 years, and with all memory of future events intact; however, they do not have the ability to change any actions, as they do not have free will. As is often the case with Vonnegut, the book was the story ABOUT the story, which will probably only make sense if you've ever read much Vonnegut. I was really hoping for so much more from Timequake, but was ultimately let down, as I felt that the ideas and ramifications of the time reset event were not really explored to any degree at all. <br/><br/>So... Toward Yesterday is the book that I'd wished Timequake could've been, even though I could not stop comparing it to Replay. However, to be perfectly clear - Toward Yesterday is definitely not as good as Replay, even though it had potential to be. <br/><br/>To me, this book failed to be as good as it could've been on 2.5 fronts:<br/>1) The final 1/4 of the book has an additional layer of drama to it that is totally unnecessary, in my opinion. It's also based on a coincidence that one of the characters themselves mentions must be a trillion to one. Unfortunately, it was telegraphed from nearly the beginning and simply added nothing to the book beyond padding the word count.<br/>1.5) There is a romance sub-plot that also seems totally unnecessary, or at the very least - totally underused (<spoiler>It would've been very interesting to have pointed out that even though biologically there was only a 10? year difference between the lovers, one had an additional 20+ years aging and experience on the other, so, in effect, it was more of a 30+ year age difference</spoiler>)<br/>2) The cop-out ending <spoiler>The bomb killed all the team and destroyed the experiment, but it still worked out anyway because of ... alternate timelines spilling over? or something... whatever it takes to tack on an ending to the book, right?</spoiler>.<br/><br/>So in the end, I liked the book, but wish that it could've been just a little bit better.",,Length: 07 hrs and 29 mins<br/>Narrated By Alexander Cendese,,,,0,,,,,

Overall, I liked this book. As a 47 y/o man, I am probably not a good representative of the target demographic. I actually read quite a bit of YA, but that's usually IN SPITE of the romance angle. The author seemed to want to try to take this into the teen romance direction a few times, but luckily, that part never really got off the ground. <br/>This was a fun book, a little predictable, but that's not always a negative. I thought that the ending seemed to come out of left field (so, therefore, I didn't predict it :D ) - almost seemed to be a rushed job to end the book. <br/>One other thing that I can't help but point out - this book could really use a good copyeditor to look it over. There were multiple instances of the wrong word in place (e.g. ""as lease"" instead of ""at least""), showing that a spell check incorrectly fixed something. Other instances where a word was missing (little ones, like ""of"" or ""to""), which, while not affecting the meaning of a phrase, did distract from the readability.<br/>I think that this book shows that the author has real talent in coming up with an interesting plot, and I look forward to more from her.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Luckily, the YA Romance part of it was definitely on the lighter side as far as actual longing and pining go, but I could see that it could be ramped up in the sequels. <br/>The story of angels coming to earth and destroying humanity could, frankly, sound a little off-putting to me, as an atheist. However, I gave it a shot, and the first 75% of the book was a bit too dragging on the slow side. But... that last 25% is where the pedal hit the floor and the book became simulatenously awesome, creepy, horrifying and utterly captivating. (For those who've read the book, without getting spoilery, I'm referring to the point when Penryn goes into the basement.)<br/>So I've rated this on a roughly split basis - the first 75% is 2 stars, the last 25% is 5 stars.

But after the 3rd or so story, some of the off-hand and cryptic comments that the unnamed (ok, ok... ""Digger"") protagonist made start solidifying, and we learn that there is much more to this story than we were lead to believe.<br/>A quick diversion - both my father and stepfather served in Vietnam, and while I grew up aware of this fact, it's only been within the last couple of years that I've learned just how traumatic that experience was for my dad. I was lucky to have done my own military service between conflicts (getting out shortly after Desert Storm ramped up), and therefore don't have to deal with the effects of PTSD directly. But one of the things that I've only recently began to comprehend was just how much my dad was struggling with PTSD; to the point where I can honestly say that much of who _I_ am today can be traced back to _his_ PTSD issues.<br/>So reading this book, the back half of which deals rather heavily with PTSD, I couldn't help but place my father in the narrator's shoes. That helped add some weight (for me) to a story that ended up being quite a bit weightier than I expected. <br/>Although I really shouldn't have been THAT surprised - Howey DOES have a pretty good track record with me, after all.<br/><br/>This line still haunts me (paraphrased slightly):<br/><i>You don't cry just because you're in pain - you cry to let others know that you're in pain</i>",true,Length: 06 hrs and 06 mins<br/>Narrated By Ryan McCarthy,,,,0,,,,,

It's MASSIVE and it's fantasy, which is a genre that I sometimes struggle with (I usually prefer Sci-Fi and Time Travel). However, I really enjoyed the Reckoners series, and this book was so highly-rated that I felt I had to give it a shot. <br/><br/>I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>I did have a couple of issues with the book, although I suppose that this is more of a learning curve that I need to overcome for either this TYPE of book or this series in general. The first issue I had was that there were a couple of parts that seemed to drag a bit (although on hindsight, both Kaladin and Dalinar's arcs would not be as powerful without their respective backstories). The second was that there were characters that were introduced earlier in the book that were either not mentioned again, or not mentioned until much later.<br/><br/>But there is so much to like about this book, most specifically the world building that the author has achieved. Such a deep history and mythology, although it often felt like TOO much to take in all at once. <br/><br/>So now I'm stoked - looks like this is set to be a 10 volume series (YIKES!), but only 2 are out so far. On to the next one!<br/><br/>Audiobook notes - Overall, very good narration from the ""Team"" of Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. Both readers handled different characterizations very well. The only problem that I had was that there were a number of times where they pronounced words differently; the worst had to be:<br/>Devotaries: DEV-oh-tarries vs de-VOTER -ees<br/>Sadeas: SAD-ee-us vs sa-DEE-us<br/>",,"Length: 45 hrs and 37 mins<br/>Narrated By Kate Reading, Michael Kramer",,,,0,,,,,

Or was it more likely that he'd turn the story into something much more interesting?<br/>So I stuck with it and indeed, the story DID turn into more interesting territory. Granted- not earth-shattering or ground-breaking, but a good story that was not any longer than it needed to be. <br/>In the end, this is an easily-skipped item in Howey's catalog. Please don't judge his much better works on this one. ",,Length: 06 hrs and 10 mins<br/>Narrated By Max Miller,,,,0,,,,,

Both books start off with a precocious super-smart baby. Both of those books suffered greatly (IMO) because of this. Babies are simply not relatable by most people. Sure, we understand how to care for them, and we love them and take delight in watching them learn and grow. But we cannot RELATE to them. We don't really know what they're feeling or thinking. Sure, we can deduce quite a bit: THIS cry means hunger, THIS cry means wet diaper, etc. But our baby is NOT thinking ""I'm not getting enough protein in my diet, so I'm going to scrounge around for edible plants until I get some"". Our baby is NOT thinking ""I know that humans won't like me talking like them, so I'll just cry instead"". Obviously, this has something to do with this book, where the story starts with the protagonist's birth and instant intellectual prowess. I was very worried that this book was going to end up being another Ender's Shadow. Luckily, the baby - Akin - wasn't a true human, so it was much easier to accept the super-smart baby parts. And also luckily, Akin grew up over the course of the book (only counts as a spoiler if you're a dunce).<br/>The story itself was not quite as compelling as the first book in the trilogy, [b:Dawn|60929|Dawn (Xenogenesis, #1)|Octavia E.

Overall, it was very compelling; I liked the idea of Doro and Anyanwu being these human immortals, about the story taking centuries to tell, about the struggles each of them felt to hold on to their humanity. I liked how it ended in a much different way than I was expecting it to.  <br/>However, I also felt like the actual prose dragged a bit too much. I can't really pinpoint exactly lines of text, but there were many times where it felt like Anyanwu or Doro were just repeating themselves. Maybe it's just me. I was hoping for a little more action, but this is not an action-based story - it's a slow-simmer, which the ending perfectly complemented. So perhaps this one was just an example of how a book subverted my expectations in a good way.<br/><br/>Audiobook notes - nothing negative to say about the narration. The female reader handled the male voices quite well - just a slight deepening of the voice, rather than attempting to channel a male impersonator (as the narrator of Wool did). There were many African words that I was not familiar with, and therefore I'm not sure if they were pronounced correctly; but the words were pronounced confidently (I've heard some readers give a slight pause before unfamiliar foreign words), which goes a long way in establishing credibility.<br/><br/>",,Length: 11 hrs and 16 mins<br/>Narrated By Dion Graham,,,,0,,,,,

I finished this book. or books. Was this actually 2 books that were shuffled together like a deck of cards? On the one hand, a fairly straight-forward depiction of life after the collapse of society. And then there was another book describing in much depth, the background of many people that did not survive said collapse of society; people that had no direct role in either the collapse or the life after the collapse. People whose lives were rather boring and (again) straight-forward. <br/><br/>I kept waiting for 2 things to happen, and only one of them actually did:<br/>1) the reveal of the prophet. I pegged this one at exactly the 66% mark <spoiler> - when it was revealed that Clark, Elizabeth and Tyler's plane was diverted to Severn City</spoiler><br/>2) I thought - in fact, right up until the last page - that there was a chance that the world would turn out to be either <spoiler>Station Eleven itself</spoiler>, or <spoiler>Arthur's dying dream</spoiler>.<br/><br/>One thing that I liked about this book is that there weren't any zombies. There wasn't any supernatural forces come to raze the survivors. No aliens. Except for The Prophet, no maniacs seizing power. Just people trying to survive. Don't get me wrong - I love all of those things generally. But it is nice to see a story that can be made WITHOUT them. It makes those things a bit more special when they DO occur in a book.<br/><br/>Ok, so where are we with this review? The characters were mostly unexciting - not necessarily boring or intolerable - just ... blahhhhhh. (You know, like most people in Real Life). The post-collapse depiction was nice. The pre-collapse life took up way too much of the book. The connections between the characters was... pointless? So - I didn't hate reading this book. I didn't hate the ending. I wasn't bored. But I definitely didn't love it. So a straight-up middle-of-the-road 3/5 stars from me.<br/><br/>Audiobook notes - very nicely read by Kirsten Potter.

Likewise, Simmons sometimes seemed to write like he was getting paid by the word; many times the narrative was broken by a long list of Alien/Foreign/Futuristic names (characters, mountain ranges, planets, etc).<br/><br/>But overall the story was very captivating to me and I found myself incredibly caught up in it. <br/><br/>Audiobook notes: the narrator was Victor Bevine, who also read the others in the series.

This book started off promising, and then it hit a really long dry part. So long and dry, actually, that I was about to give up on it. There's really only so much teen/alien angst that I can tolerate. But at about the 75% mark the book shifted perspective back to the character from the more-exciting beginning and it got MOSTLY good again. Still a little bit of teen angst, but definitely toned down a bit from the dry part.<br/><br/>One small thing that really irritated me - the title was repeated by nearly every character at some point, and almost always about a different thing.

I did not catch the names if they were the same as in the first book, but they both did a fine job. As with the first book, it was helpful that there were different readers since from the text of the book was not clear when the perspectives changed.

What I liked best about this short story is how the story ended up in a much different place than I expected it to at the beginning. I've also really enjoyed this look into the life and culture of hedge knights - a term that was used quite often in ASOFAI, but really didn't mean much to me.<br/>And finally - a note on the audiobook version: all three novellas were narrated by different men - the first one's voice was too soft and kind (think: Mr. Rogers), and not the best fit for this style of writing. The second one was much better, a bit more serious and adult sounding. However, with this third narrator, we're taking a step... sideways? While the first two readers(and the narrator of the ASOFAI books themselves) was either British or near enough as makes no difference, this narrator had a very distinctively flat American accent which was almost a distraction in itself, but his most grevious offense (IMO) was pronouncing ""Ser"" not as ""Sir"" but as ""Sair"".

Usually if a story is explicitly set in a specific time period it's so that the author can take advantage of that time (for instance: story complications that would be easily resolved by modern technology or even a change in political/social environments). As the story wore (dragged) on, I kept expecting to see SOMETHING that would explain the time period setting, and seeing nothing obvious (to my admittedly addled brain) I assumed that the reason lay in the fact that the main characters are not bound to normal human life spans and that the story would then unfold over many decades, and it was a bit disappointing that only a year or so elapsed in the story. <spoiler>Yes, I know the jinni's story technically started 1,000 years ago, but that was all flashback</spoiler><br/><br/>Ok, not sure how much that helped.

This book is a coming of age story about a rather naive middle-schooler and the boring things that she thinks about.  The SETTING for this coming of age story is the afore-mentioned slowing of the earth, and the author is really not concerned with exploring the idea of the catastrophe beyond the various effects that she can conjure for story purposes. She even admits (via the protagonist) that she can't come up with an explanation for why this is happening, or even why the different effects occurred (e.g. <Spoiler>Why did the birds and whales all die?</spoiler>)<br/>I find myself wanting to know more about the seemingly-impossible disaster, and not caring one bit for the characters. <br/>Also, at the end Julia mentions that they've figured out how to <spoiler>send a rocket up again and they're using it to launch a new deep-space probe with a gold disk explaining to any aliens out there who we were and what our oceans sounded like.

It started off slow and then... <br/><br/>LISTS<br/><br/>and not just ANY lists - lists of authors and scientists and composers, both well-known and obscure. Was there a point to these lists? Doubtful, except to show the author's pretentiousness (""oh, look, I name-dropped PROUST! I must be SOOOO intellectual""). Maybe it's because I'd recently finished The Hyperion Cantos, but I'm very weary of books with long lists that prove nothing except the author's research skills.<br/><br/>This is the line that finally did it for me:<br/><br/><i>There is an escarpment named Pourquoi Pas.</i><br/><br/>I have no idea what that means. It's the final line in a chapter comprised solely of geographical names based on the afore-mentioned authors, scientists and composers. I'm a pretty smart guy, but I guess I'm not smart enough to read this book. And it seems that the author wants to PROVE that I'm not smart enough, but I'm not going to stick around to give him that chance.<br/><br/>Perhaps this book really is as good as everyone says it is. Maybe the LIST issue is not that big of a problem when you're reading the book with your own eyeballs and can quickly skim over them, but as an audiobook listener, that's not as easy to do. <br/><br/>So I'll have to add this to the gave-up-on shelf ",,,,,,0,,,,,

Stephen King's book UR mentions this book as the book that Hemingway always writes <spoiler>no matter what alternate universe/timeline occurs</spoiler>. So to me that was an indication that this would be an outstanding book. <br/>However... this really felt like two books - a war story and a romance. The war story was interesting in that it painted a pretty bleak picture of what WWI must have been like. I thought that this book was supposed to be (at least the war part) semi-autobiographical, which would have been horrifying. However, according to Wikipedia, it's not - so even that part seems a little less impressive now. <br/>The romance half of the story - DREADFUL! Catherine Barkley was so annoying with the constant questions and insecurity. It was like reading about a tween schoolyard love affair. I hated everything about the Catherine story.<br/>I think that in a few weeks I'll try another Hemingway novel, but if I feel like I'm back in school reading an assignment then I'm going to have to give up on him.

I've been looking forward to reading it for quite awhile, and when a friend (hi Devon :D ) started gushing about it, I bumped it up in my read priority. I'd just finished the first 3 Song of Fire and Ice books, so my mind was already in this quasi-fantasy mindset. However, this book is definitely NOT Game of Thrones. The pacing is oh so much slower and the characters not as compelling as most in that series. <br/>It took me about half the book before I finally realized what the main issue was: the audiobook narrator was SOOOOOO slow. I switched to 2x speed and it greatly helped the pace without sacrificing very much, if any, comprehension. I frequently switch between ebook and audiobook versions, and the audiobook really frustrated me at 1x speed.<br/>As far as the story, I was hoping that there would be more time travel elements, and I think that this book assumes a certain minimum familiarity with 18th Century English/Scottish/French history, as there were more than a few offhand remarks that obviously were supposed to MEAN SOMETHING; for instance: references to people being Jacobites. That term really meant almost nothing to me and pretty much was not explained.<br/>Overall, it was a good book, and I'm glad that I stuck it out, as the last third of the book was much more interesting.",,Length: 32 hrs and 43 mins<br/>Narrated By Davina Porter,,,,0,,,,,

I have no recollection of ever seeing the Kevin Costner movie based on it, but I'll probably seek it out now. The book depicted (to me) a realistic picture of life almost 2 decades after the collapse of civilization. There's no zombies here, no supernatural influence. Just the horror of stronger people taking advantage of others not able to stand up for themselves. And that is every bit as terrifying as zombies and ghosts. <br/>I dinged the rating a bit because I thought that the book slogged down some in the middle, and I also thought that the view pretty much by all the characters regarding the weakness of women was a bit too simplistic. This book only came out in the mid-90's, so, while this might have been understandable in an older book from the mid-century, it was just too distracting at the surprise felt when a woman exhibited any strength of character.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Well, I was very pleasantly surprised to have been wrong about that. Yes, there's quite a bit of the fish-out-of-water part to it (but really - that's the appeal of most time travel stories, right?), and there's definitely a Message and Learning Experience here, but I would argue that it's not heavy-handed. The characters are well-drawn, with multiple layers, with the possible exception of the narrator herself and her husband (or at least - they get the least amount of definition). The slaves are not painted as all one mind - some are accepting of their situation (with varying degrees of reluctance), while others are much more rankled by the reality and frustration of being a slave. The slaves were compassionate and understanding, as well as conniving and back-stabbing; in short, they were fully realized, deep people, and not just perfect subjugated angels without flaws. Likewise, the white people were also portrayed in a realistic manner - some were brutal, harsh people, but most were some combination of brutal and kind, condescending and compassionate, mean and fair. Honestly, none of the main characters (white OR black) really come off as unbelievably GOOD or BAD. In the end, I was just so glad that I was not around during that time period, and it's given me a deeper appreciation for the horrible lives that these people lived. So in that way, this has been a very profound book for me.<br/>Now, the time travel aspect was handled very well, I thought - a little light on details and explanations, but that was alright, as the focus on the book was not really the ramifications of the time travel as much as it was on building a view into life in the early 1800's.<br/>The only part of the book that I thought was lacking was an explanation for <spoiler>Dana's amputation - I don't get at all why that was even a necessary part of the story, let alone the mechanics of it, since it differed so much from her other travels through time</spoiler>.<br/>Audiobook notes - the narrator did a fantastic job handling the various voices.<br/><br/><br/>",,Length: 10 hrs and 59 mins<br/>Narrated By Kim Staunton,,,,0,,,,,

In addition, I remember the first book (Doomsday Book) being a bit heavy. So as prep, I started Three Men In A Boat, and decided that after a chapter or 2 that I didn't need to finish it, and that I got the general gist of the book. <br/>On to THIS book, then. And except for the chapter headings? summaries? and only a small few mentions of 3MIAB, I found that I'd definitely been over-sold on the necessity of being familiar with 3MIAB. Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to state that the chapter heading/summaries gimmick wore out REALLY fast. Nothing like spoiling your own book in the middle of it.<br/>Anyway, this story was crazy-complicated (as all good Time Travel books should be), especially at the end as they were trying to tie everything together. But it was a lot of fun, and there were some very funny parts. The whole tone of the book was so much lighter than Doomsday Book, and I appreciated the minimum amount of exposition needed to explain Time Travel and the net. <br/><br/>Audiobook notes - the narrator did a nice job of making distinctive voices, and if there were any mispronunciations I didn't notice them.
